# Sentiment classification using word2vec and LSTM
Sentiment classification is a popular task in NLP. This notebook uses wor2vec representations and compares various classifiers: from the typical k-NN to the more advanced LSTM networks. For LSTMs specifically, we are interested in using both pre-trained and not pre-trained embeddings. The code is based on the works of:
